Task 6 — Password Strength EvaluationPasswords tested (demo)| ID | Password (sample)   | Tool Used | Strength (shown) | Estimated Time to Crack ||----|---------------------|-----------|------------------|-------------------------|| 1  | luka@2004-weak      | Bitwarden | Weak             | ~17 minutes             || 2  | 1234                | Bitwarden | Very Weak        | < 1 second              || 3  | HelloWorld!20       | Bitwarden | Good             | ~6 hours                || 4  | ma@bha14aa!         | Bitwarden | Strong           | ~4 months               |Screenshots:`screenshots/scrnshot_weak.png`screenshots/scrnshot_veryweak.png`screenshots/scrnshot_good.png`screenshots/scrnshot_strong.png---Short Analysis1234: Instantly crackable — shows why short numeric passwords are useless.luka@2004-weak: Includes a name/year → predictable, dictionary-style.HelloWorld!20: Mixed chars, but still a common phrase; better but still guessable.ma@bha14aa!: Mixes numbers, symbols, case → stronger, lasts months in brute-force.---Best Practices LearnedUse at least 12–16 characters.Avoid dictionary words, names, or dates.Add randomness with symbols & numbers.Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).Use password managers to generate & store unique strong passwords.
